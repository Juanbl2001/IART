## formulation of the problem as a search problem (state representation, initial state, objective test, operators (names, preconditions, effects and costs), heuristics/evaluation function) or optimization problem (solution representation, neighborhood/mutation and crossover functions, hard constraints, evaluation functions) - AULA

## implementation work already carried out (programming language, development environment, data structures, among others).
